Story Blog review

1 - BlogPost
I like the solution for the taggleBlog and I believe that is the most used for this case. In this file I would just remove the interface declaration concentrating all interfaces in the interface file.

2- BlogSection
I would remove the handleOnClick function and make the setToggleElement directily in the onClick like the other file to keep a uniformity and I would also remove the interface declaration concentrating all interfaces in the interface file.

3- Home
Declaring all the Tags in one array it wold make possible to you to use the map function and avoy the copy/paste in 2 ocasions. One is wen you call the BlogSection compoment and other is for the options in the selectionBar.

4 - Footer and Header
They are okay! ;)
